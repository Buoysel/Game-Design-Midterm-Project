This was the midterm project for my Game Design and Development class back in
2015. For this assignment I was given pre-made 3D assets, and I had to program
the player, obstacles, the pickup item, the goal, and design a level.

All the 3D assets were provided from the instructor, so I had to create the
scripts myself.

-Use either the arrow keys or the A and D keys to move the player left and right

-Spacebar lets the player jump

-The goal is to collect the key and reach the end of the level/
